# Pulsed Eddy Current (PEC) Based Testing

## What about PEC-based testing
Pulsed Eddy Current (PEC) is a non-destructive testing (NDT) method used to inspect steel reinforcement embedded within concrete, not the concrete itself.  
It is primarily used to detect corrosion and wall thinning in ferromagnetic materials like carbon steel and cast iron.  

## How PEC is used for concrete-enclosed steel
PEC probes emit a magnetic pulse that penetrates non-conductive materials like concrete.  
This pulse induces eddy currents in the embedded steel rebar, and the probe measures the decay rate of the resulting electromagnetic field.  

- **Detection of rebar corrosion:**  
  A faster decay rate indicates wall thinning and material loss in the rebar, signaling corrosion.  

- **Inspection through coverings:**  
  Since the signal can pass through concrete, PEC is highly valuable for inspecting rebar without removing concrete or other insulating materials.  

- **Average thickness measurement:**  
  PEC provides an average wall thickness over the probeâ€™s footprint, useful for detecting general corrosion over a wide area.  

## Limitations of PEC for concrete inspection
While valuable for assessing rebar integrity, PEC is not an all-purpose defectoscope for concrete:

- **Limited to ferromagnetic materials:** Cannot detect voids or cracks in concrete itself.  
- **Insensitive to fine defects:** Works as a screening tool for large material loss, not small pits or tight cracks.  
- **Not a high-resolution tool:** Unlike GPR or ultrasonics, PEC does not produce detailed images.  
- **Averaged readings:** Footprint-based measurement may underestimate small flaws.
